# unify_app

A new Flutter project.

## Personal Message to viewers

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
- This project is the cloned and edited version of my own previously developed application named [UNIFY](https://github.com/RutikVasani/Unify) last year.
- Me and my friend **(Rutik)** both had worked on this application development but he has kept it private so i just cloned and re-edited the file and make it public, you can see the recently commited changes in the UI of my App from [here](https://github.com/sachinds501/unify_app).
- This was the first mobile appication which i had worked on, and tried to give my best for the project.
- This was my 3rd sem project.

## Description of the app
- **Unify** : This application is created with the purpose of easy and fine interaction between the faculties and the students at the school and administrator level. This application contains front end as well the **backend part** in few of the sections. Our application allows you to chat, ask Queries to the faculty in systematic form.
- **Login Page** : The Login Page has the user credentials section, where users can enter his crendentials to login. **Note:** Here there is no signup option for the students because the credential is provided by the adimin i.e. ***Faculty***. So the student can only Login through the credentials provided by the faculty. This Login Page contians Text animation. 
- **HomePage** : The homepage consist of three tabs **Chat, Calendar, Query**.
- **Drawer** : Drawer has **User Profile Section, Noticeboard, Syllabus, Assignments, Setting, Polling, About and Login** ListTiles.
